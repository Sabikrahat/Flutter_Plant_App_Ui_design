# Plant App - Flutter UI

Nice clean plant app UI using flutter, the Home page you will get search box than a horizontal list of recommended plants. At the bottom featured plans list. On the details page, a big image with its 4 icons on the right side also add to the cart button.

Here I've used:

- Box Decoration with box shadow.
- Image.asset for icons.

I've taken help from youtube. Link is given below:
